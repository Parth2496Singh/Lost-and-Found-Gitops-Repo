# 💻 Developer Guide: Application Onboarding & Helm Blueprint

This guide explains how developers can leverage the **Universal DRY Helm Chart** to instantly deploy and scale their applications without writing raw Kubernetes YAML. The definitive reference template can be found in `apps/example-microservice/values.yaml`.

Because this template is highly advanced, a single `values.yaml` file can completely transform the underlying Kubernetes architecture, allowing you to deploy Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and ServiceMonitors effortlessly.

## 1. How to Add a New Microservice

Adding a new application to the cluster is completely automated via GitOps. We use the **Umbrella Chart Pattern** to dynamically import your infrastructure blueprint from an AWS ECR OCI registry.

1. **Create a new folder** inside the `apps/` directory with your application's name (e.g., `apps/payment-service/`).
2. **Create a `Chart.yaml`** to import the universal blueprint:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v2
   name: payment-service
   version: 1.0.0
   dependencies:
     - name: common-microservice
       version: 1.0.1  # The version of the universal blueprint in ECR
       repository: oci://815090125753.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/universal-helm-chart
   ```
3. **Create your `values.yaml`** to configure your app. (Note: everything must be indented under `common-microservice:`):
   ```yaml
   common-microservice:
     replicaCount: 2
     image:
       repository: "..."
       tag: "v1.0.0"
   ```
4. **Generate the Lockfile (CRITICAL):** Argo CD requires a lockfile to ensure deterministic GitOps state. Run this locally:
   ```bash
   aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | helm registry login --username AWS --password-stdin 815090125753.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
   helm dependency update apps/payment-service/
   ```
5. **Commit and push** the `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, and the generated `Chart.lock` to the `main` branch. 
   *(Argo CD will automatically detect the new folder, download the OCI blueprint, and deploy it).*

## 2. Configuring the Universal Template (`values.yaml`)

The Universal Helm Chart acts as a machine. Depending on what you toggle in your `values.yaml`, it will generate different Kubernetes resources. Below is a comprehensive guide to all advanced configurations.

### 2.1 Changing the Workload Type
By default, your app is deployed as a Kubernetes `Deployment`. If your application requires stateful persistent storage or needs to run exactly one Pod on every Node, you can instantly change the core architecture:

```yaml
common-microservice:
  # Options: "Deployment", "StatefulSet", "DaemonSet"
  workloadType: "StatefulSet"
```

### 2.2 Migrating Local `.env` Files to Kubernetes
In local development (Docker Compose), you rely on a `.env` file to pass environment variables to your application. In Kubernetes, you cannot mount a `.env` file directly. Instead, Kubernetes uses **ConfigMaps** (for non-sensitive data) and **Secrets** (for sensitive passwords/tokens).

Our Universal Helm Chart makes this migration effortless. You simply copy-paste the values from your `.env` file directly into your `values.yaml` using the `envConfig` and `secrets` blocks. The chart will dynamically generate the Kubernetes objects and inject them into your Pod as standard environment variables (so your code can still read them natively via `process.env` or `os.environ`).

#### Non-Sensitive Variables (ConfigMap)
Do **not** write raw ConfigMap YAML. Define them here:
```yaml
common-microservice:
  envConfig:
    DJANGO_DEBUG: "True"
    NODE_ENV: "production"
    BACKEND_INTERNAL_URL: "http://backend:8000"
```

#### Sensitive Variables (Secrets)
Similarly, you can dynamically generate and mount Kubernetes Secrets:
*(Note: In a true production environment, consider using External Secrets Operator (ESO) instead of committing plaintext secrets to Git).*
```yaml
common-microservice:
  secrets:
    DATABASE_URL: "postgres://user:password@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"
    GITHUB_PAT: "your_github_personal_access_token_here"
    DJANGO_SECRET_KEY: "velzion-insecure-key"
```

### 2.4 Enabling Prometheus Metrics (ServiceMonitor)
If your application exposes a `/metrics` endpoint, you can automatically generate a Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` to tell the Prometheus Operator to start scraping it. No `ServiceMonitor` YAML required!

```yaml
common-microservice:
  metrics:
    enabled: true       # Turns on the ServiceMonitor generation
    port: "http"        # Must match the named port in the Service
    path: "/metrics"    # The URL path where metrics are exposed
    interval: "30s"     # How often Prometheus should scrape
```

### 2.5 The Escape Hatch (Raw Kubernetes Manifests)
If your microservice requires a highly specific Kubernetes resource that the Universal Chart doesn't support (e.g., a `NetworkPolicy`, `CronJob`, or a custom `RoleBinding`), use the `extraManifests` escape hatch.

The template will read this list and render it exactly as raw YAML:

```yaml
common-microservice:
  extraManifests:
    - apiVersion: batch/v1
      kind: CronJob
      metadata:
        name: my-app-cleanup-job
      spec:
        schedule: "0 2 * * *"
        jobTemplate:
          spec:
            template:
              spec:
                containers:
                  - name: cleaner
                    image: busybox
                    args: ["echo", "cleaning up!"]
                restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

## 3. Configuring the Global GitOps Engine (`gitops-control-plane`)

While the `apps/` directory controls individual microservices, the **`gitops-control-plane/values.yaml`** file controls the master Argo CD deployment engine itself. 

If you are setting up this boilerplate for a new project, you **must** edit this file to ensure Argo CD knows where to look for your code:

*   **`argocd.repoUrl`**: Change this to the Git URL of your repository. If you don't, Argo CD will try to deploy code from the original Boilerplate repo!
*   **`argocd.appPrefix`**: Prepended to all your apps (e.g., if prefix is "acme", the backend app becomes "acme-backend").
*   **`notifications.email`**: Update the `sender`, `receiver`, and `host` to point to your actual team's email addresses so you get alerted when deployments succeed or fail.
*   **`registry.ecrBaseUrl`**: Update this with your 12-digit AWS Account ID and region so the Image Updater knows where to look for new Docker tags.

---

## 4. Best Practices for Developers
*   **The Blueprint is External:** The universal blueprint lives in its own repository: **[universal-helm-chart](https://github.com/Parth2496Singh/universal-helm-chart)**. If you need a new global Kubernetes resource (like a `CronJob` template), you must contribute to that repository and bump the `version` tag.
*   **Keep it DRY**: If you find yourself using `extraManifests` to deploy the exact same resource across 15 different microservices, it is time to ask the Platform Engineering team to build it natively into the `universal-helm-chart`.
